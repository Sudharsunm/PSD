<p id="top"><strong>A computer</strong> is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation.</p>
<p><strong>Computer</strong> is an electronic device that is designed to work with Information. The term computer is derived from the Latin term ‘computare’, this means to calculate or programmable machine. Computer can not do anything without a Program. It represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. The Word ‘Computer’ usually refers to the Center Processor Unit plus Internal memory.
Charles Babbage is called the "Father of the computer". The First mechanical computer designed by Charles Babbage was called Analytical Engine. It uses read-only memory in the form of punch cards.
The computer is an electronic device that takes input from the user and processes these data under the control of a set of instructions (called program) and gives the result (output) and saves future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations.</p>
